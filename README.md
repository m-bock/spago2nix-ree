# spago2nix-ree

Work in progress re-implementation of [spago2nix](https://github.com/justinwoo/spago2nix).
The idea is that dependencies don't need to be rebuilt for every change in your project. Instead they get cached with nix derivations.
Works only partly until now.

Not yet recommended to use.
